## Installation
Currently you can only install this as a local plugin. To do so run the 
following command:

**`$ git clone git@github.com:kvelcich/hyper-kev.git ~/.hyper_plugins/local`**

**Note:** If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) you'll need to 
instead clone the repository into the Hyper App Data folder. For example into:
`/mnt/c/Users/kev/AppData/Roaming/Hyper/.hyper_plugins/local`

Then simply add **hyper-kev** as a local plugin within your `.hyper.js` file.
```javascript
localPlugins: [
  //...
  'hyper-kev',
  //...
],
```
