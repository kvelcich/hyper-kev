## Installation
Currently you can only install this as a local plugin. To do so run the 
following script:
`git clone git@github.com:kvelcich/hyper-kevin.git ~/.hyper_plugins/local`

Note: If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) you'll need to instead
place that under your Windows uesr directory. For example:
`git clone git@github.com:kvelcich/hyper-kevin.git /mnt/c/Users/kevin/.hyper_plugins/local`

## Credits
Theme and code is inspired (or copied) from [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy).
